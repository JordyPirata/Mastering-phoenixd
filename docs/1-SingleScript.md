# Single Script Installation

The easiest way to install phoenixd is using our automated installation script. This script handles downloading, verification, and setup of phoenixd on your Linux system.

## Quick Install

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btcgdl/Mastering-phoenixd/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Or if you prefer to download and inspect the script first:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btcgdl/Mastering-phoenixd/master/scripts/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## What the Script Does

The installation script performs the following operations:

1. **Downloads phoenixd v0.6.0** from the official ACINQ GitHub releases
2. **Verifies the package integrity** using GPG signatures and checksums
3. **Installs to a directory in your PATH** (default: `~/.local/bin`)
4. **Configures your shell environment** to recognize the phoenixd command
5. **Optionally sets up a systemd service** for automatic startup

## Installation Process

When you run the script, you'll see:

```
‚ö°Ô∏è Welcome to Mastering phoenixd installer
-----------------------------------------
Installing phoenixd 0.6.0 from github.com/ACINQ/phoenixd/releases/download/v0.6.0
```

### Installation Directory

The script will prompt for an installation directory:

```
Absolute install directory path (default: /home/user/.local/bin):
```

- **Default**: `~/.local/bin` (recommended for single-user installations)
- **Custom**: You can specify any directory you prefer

### Package Verification

The script includes automatic verification:

```
üîê Starting package verification...
‚úÖ Package verification successful.
‚úÖ Verification successful. The package is authentic and intact.
```

This ensures you're installing an authentic, unmodified version of phoenixd.

### PATH Configuration

If installing to `~/.local/bin`, the script automatically:

- Checks if the directory is in your PATH
- Adds it to your shell configuration if needed
- Provides instructions to activate the changes

### Systemd Service Setup

After installation, you'll be asked:

```
Do you want to setup a systemd service (requires sudo permission)? (y/n):
```

If you choose **yes**:
- Creates a systemd service file at `/etc/systemd/system/phoenixd.service`
- Enables and starts the service
- Configures phoenixd to run on testnet by default
- Sets up automatic restart on failure

If you choose **no**:
- You can run phoenixd manually with the `phoenixd` command
- Use `phoenix-cli` to interact with the daemon

## Post-Installation

After successful installation:

### Manual Operation
```bash
# Start phoenixd manually
phoenixd --agree-to-terms-of-service

# In another terminal, interact with phoenixd
phoenix-cli getinfo
```

### Systemd Service (if enabled)
```bash
# Control the service
sudo systemctl start phoenixd
sudo systemctl stop phoenixd
sudo systemctl restart phoenixd

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status phoenixd

# View logs
journalctl -u phoenixd -f
```

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux (x64)
- **Dependencies**: `wget`, `gpg`, `unzip`, `sha256sum`
- **Network**: Internet connection for downloads
- **Permissions**: Write access to installation directory, sudo for systemd service

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found after installation

If `phoenixd` command is not recognized after installation:

```bash
# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc

# Or restart your terminal
```

### Verification failures

If package verification fails:
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure GPG is properly installed
- Visit the [official releases page](https://github.com/ACINQ/phoenixd/releases) for manual verification

### Permission issues

If you encounter permission errors:
- Ensure you have write access to the installation directory
- Use `sudo` for system-wide installations
- Consider using the default `~/.local/bin` directory

## Security Notes

The installation script:
- ‚úÖ Downloads from official ACINQ sources only
- ‚úÖ Verifies packages using GPG signatures
- ‚úÖ Validates checksums before installation
- ‚úÖ Uses secure HTTPS connections
- ‚úÖ Provides full transparency of operations

Always review scripts before running them with elevated privileges.
